## Introduction
This guide provides instructions on setting up a machine learning environment with TensorFlow.


## Installation

### Step 1: Downloading Dataset

</p>

You can download the Rock, Paper, Scissors dataset from Kaggle by following this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/rock-paper-scissors-dataset), which contains labeled images of hands playing the game, useful for building classification models.

### Step 2: Uploading Dataset to Google Drive

</p>

To upload a dataset to Google Drive after unzipping it, follow these steps:

**Unzip the Dataset**:
   - Locate the zipped file on your computer.
   - Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" (Windows) or "Open" (Mac) to unzip it.
   - Choose a destination folder to extract the files.

**Upload to Google Drive**:
   - Open your web browser and go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
   - Sign in to your Google account if prompted.
   - In Google Drive, click on the "+ New" button on the left side.
   - Select "Folder Upload" if you want to upload an entire folder, or "File Upload" if you're uploading individual files.
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the dataset, select it, and click "Upload."

**Wait for the Upload to Complete**:
   - Youâ€™ll see a progress bar indicating the upload status. Wait until it's finished.
   - HEADS UP ! It might take a while!

**Check Your Files**:
   - After the upload is complete, you should see the dataset in your Google Drive. Should be a large dataset(rock-paper-scissors)!

That's it! Your dataset is now available in Google Drive for further use. If you have any questions or need help with a specific step, feel free to ask!

## Step 3: Mounting Google Collab


**Go to Google Colab**:
   - Click on link to redirect to google colab!
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

**Open book Option**:
   - A page looking like this should pop up! Go to the github option and copy this repository and paste it!

   ```

</p>

   - It should look like this and click on improvement.ipyb (in the photo it doesn't show yet)!

## Setup Finalization

   - Once in the notebook, make sure that this code is in your notebook.


<p align="center">

</p>

```python 
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

```python
    import os

    # Change directory to a specific folder in your Google Drive
    os.chdir('/content/drive/My Drive/Rock-Paper-Scissors')

    # Print the current working directory
    print(os.getcwd())
```
   - Run the program, make sure there is no issues. If there is issues make sure that the path matches how it looks in your google drive.
